## tl;dr

1. Go to https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/${WSAbbreviation}/pub/scmd.cgi?scmd=ACLPUB, where ${WSAbbreviation} is your workshop abbreviation on softconf.

2. Your goal is to get to the last step, Generate `All`, under the **Generate** tab, without any errors.

:point_right: :point_right: It has to look good and abide by the ACL paper and style guidelines. It's up to you to make sure it does. :point_left: :point_left: :ok_hand: :thumbsup:

## Introduction

This page is for conference organizers (main conference, workshop &
demo chairs) who need to put together a book for inclusion in the
ACL proceedings. 

You will need your ACL ID Prefix and your ISBN number.
You can find those here, in [this ACL 2017 Workshops google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x1RtUjAy-S_YhvTXWTrUc5xs9_4HkF0pOGynhRE963M/edit?usp=sharing).

You should be able to produce your proceedings entirely within the START manager console.  Once your book builds without error using the `All` button under the
Generate tab, let the publications chairs know by e-mailing us at
[acl-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:acl-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com).
We will collect the books online using START. There is no need to
e-mail us any zipped files.

We will update this page periodically with ACL 2017-specific details and answers to frequently
asked questions as they arise. If you encounter any problems with this
process, please email us.

## Instructions

To get to the Softconf ACL Proceedings Generator: 
 - Go to your workshop's softconf website:  https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/${WSAbbreviation}, where ${WSAbbreviation} is your workshop abbreviation on softconf.
 - Go to the Publication Console (/pub):  https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/${WSAbbreviation}/pub
 - Under **Conference Program**, follow the `ACLPUB` link.   
   <kbd>
   ![alt text](howto_images/aclpub.png "ACLPUB link.")
   </kbd>  
   This will bring you to the url:  https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/${WSAbbreviation}/pub/scmd.cgi?scmd=ACLPUB
 - Now you should see the `ACLPUB Proceedings Generator`.
   <kbd>![alt text](howto_images/start_tabs.png "Left to Right START Tabs.")</kbd>

The Softconf ACL Proceedings Generator creates two things:

   -  A book proceedings, based in latex.   The files used in the generation of the book proceedings are shown in [Table 1](#table-1--files-used-in-book-proceedings-generation).

   -  An online proceedings, based in html.  Compiling the book proceedings end-to-end also produces the online proceedings.  The files used in the generation of the online proceedings are shown in [Table 2](#table-2--files-used-in-online-proceedings-generation).
   
Next we walk through how to use the Softconf ACL Proceedings Generator to create the book proceedings and the online proceedings.

# Step by Step Compilation in the Softconf ACLPUB Proceedings Generator

---
*Jump to Step:*

[1: Margins](#step-1--margins-tab) &middot; [2: Dwnl Templates](#step-2--dwnl-templates-tab) &middot;  [3: Order](#step-3--order-tab) [4: Templates](#step-4--templates-tab)  &middot; [5: Online Proceedings (CDROM)](#step-5--cdrom-tab-online-proceedings-tab)  &middot;  [6: Program](#step-6--program-tab)  &middot; [7: TOC](#step-7--toc-tab)  &middot; [8: Generate!](#step-8--generate-tab-trophy-trophy)

## Step 1:  Margins Tab
[Jump to Step 2](#step-2--dwnl-templates-tab)
 

 ![alt text](howto_images/margins.png "The Margins Tab.")
 
Use this tab to correct the margins on the papers in the proceedings.  Going to this tab should display a table of the first 10 papers.  To see all the papers, change the `Page length` value at the top of the table to more than the number of papers you received, e.g., `100`.  

To see the current margins for each paper in the table:  In the left column, click on the rightmost `Edit Submission`.  This is circled in red in the example image.  This will bring you to the authors' final uploaded paper, where you can take a look at how well the margins fit, and adjust accordingly.

You can also change margins by clicking on the cell all the way to the right -- this will bring up the Margins adjustment, circled in red in the image. 


## Step 2:  Dwnl Templates Tab
[Jump to Step 3](#step-3--order-tab)

   ![alt text](howto_images/dwnl_templates.png "The Download/Upload Tab.")
 
Download the ACLPUB `.zip` file, add in your sponsorship logos, rezip, and upload.  To download all the current files, click on the "Current ACLPub Templates", circled here in red.  You will receive a zip file with all the files for your proceedings compilation.

Once downloaded and unzipped, **you can edit all `tex` files here directly**.  You also add sponsorship logos here.

When you are done, zip the edited directory back up again, and click the ACLPUB template zip name `Choose File`.

You can also edit all `.html` files using the CDROM `.zip`


## Step 3:  Order Tab
[Jump to Step 4](#step-4--templates-tab)
   
This tab creates the file called `order`.
 
The `order` file is used to format and order the papers in the
proceedings, in the schedule, and also to generate the handbook. 
The latter can be a
complex task, making sure that the schedule is formatted correctly and
consistently, and pulling together times across workshops (like the
student research workshop and the main proceedings). Since this is
done in LaTeX, it's important that the schedules be formatted to be
computer-readable.

You can either:
  1. Use the Schedule Maker, to figure out your schedule, and get the `order` file created from that. 
  2. Use the text in the textbox as the `order` file, editing directly using the given markup.

If you use the ScheduleMaker tool, the order file is generated automatically and should be to spec.
If you edit by the `order` file by hand, remember:

-  Times should be specified in 24-hour format (implicit AM/PM):

         + 12:00--13:30 Lunch

**This is very important for things like the digital handbook!**

-  Time ranges should be fully specified, with two dashes in between (and no spaces). Don't put just the start time.

         17 9:00--9:30 # A really great paper

-  Do not put time ranges in parentheses

-  Can also make sure your file passes [this verification script](files/verify_order.py). E.g.,

         $ cat proceedings/order | python verify_order.py
         Found 0 errors

**Order File**

The  `order` file below is from SSST-7 at NAACL 2013. You can use it as a template. 

      * Thursday, June 13, 2013

## Step 4:  Templates Tab
[Jump to Step 5](#step-5--cdrom-tab-online-proceedings-tab)


   ![alt text](howto_images/templates.png "The Templates Tab.") 


This is where you edit most of the front matter and online information for the proceedings.
To check how well each part compiles, press the buttons in the Preview Templates table.

**Remember to hit `Save templates` at the top when you edit the embedded files.**

Select among the subtabs within this tab -- Sections, Settings, Headers, and CDROM -- to expose all the embedded files for editing.

<dl>
  <dt>Files to Edit in this Tab</dt>

        <dt>Online Proceedings</dt>
        <dd>`index.html`, `authors.html`, `program.html` </dd>
        <dd> `unified-authors.html` (Publication Chairs Only), `mainindex.html` (Publication Chairs Only)</dd>
      </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>

`program.tex` will follow what is given in the `order` file ([Step 3](#step-3--order-tab)).  You edit/customize `program.tex` in [the Program Tab (Step 6)](#step-6--the-program-tab), and you can edit/customize `toc.tex` in [the TOC Tab (Step 7)](#step-7--toc-tab).  For editing/customizing the HTML, you'll need to do it offline.

### Title Page (Sections Subtab)

   [titlepage.tex](files/titlepage.tex) 

   Edit to reflect your title page.

### Copyright Page (Sections Subtab)

  [copyright.tex](files/copyright.tex) 

  Fill out the ISBN here.  This can be found [in the Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x1RtUjAy-S_YhvTXWTrUc5xs9_4HkF0pOGynhRE963M/edit?usp=sharing).  This is also where to use the \includegraphics tex call for sponsor logos, which we uploaded in [Step Two](#step-2--dwnl-templates-tab).

### Preface Page (Sections Subtab)

  [preface.tex](files/preface.tex) 

The general introductory, welcome message from the organizers goes here.
  
### Organizers Page (Sections Subtab)

  [organizers.tex](files/organizers.tex)
  
This is where you list all the people who made this possible -- Organizers, Program Committee, Advisory Board, Panel, etc.

### Citation Stamp (Settings Subtab)

   [citation-stamp.tex](files/citation-stamp.tex)

This is the official citation for your proceedings, with gets stamped on the bottom of the first page of each author's work in your proceedings.

### Spine (Settings Subtab)

   [spine.tex](files/spine.tex)

This is for the spine on book proceedings if printed.

### Book (Settings Subtab)

   [book.tex](files/book.tex)

This is the main file enveloping your proceedings.

### Program (Headers Subtab)

   [program.tex.head](files/program.tex.head)

Edit to make sure the header values reflects your conference/website. 

### TOC (Headers Subtab)

   [toc.tex.head](files/toc.tex.head)

Edit to make sure the header values reflects your conference/website.

### HTML Pages (CDROM Subtab)

   [index.html.head](files/index.html.head)

   [authors.html.head](files/authors.html.head)

   [program.html.head](files/authors.html.head)
  
These files are used to create the `index.html`, `authors.html`, and `program.html` files for the Online proceedings.  Edit the headers here so that they point to your conference/website.


## Step 5:  CDROM Tab (Online Proceedings Tab)
[Jump to Step 6](#step-6--program-tab)

 <kbd> ![alt text](howto_images/cdrom.png "The CDROM Tab.") </kbd>

You will need to fill out this tab with the correct values for your volume, 
many of which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x1RtUjAy-S_YhvTXWTrUc5xs9_4HkF0pOGynhRE963M/edit?usp=sharing).
As an example, here are the values used for the main conference proceedings:

    Abbreviation    ACL-HLT
    Type	        Main Conference
    Title	        The 2017 Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics
    URL	            http://acl2017.org
    Book Title	    Proceedings of the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics
    Month	        July-August
    Year	        2017
    Location	    Vancouver, Canada
    Publisher	    Association for Computational Linguistics
    Chair 1	        Kevin Knight (USC Information Sciences Institute)
    Chair 2	        Ani Nenkova (University of Pennsylvania) 
    Chair 3	        Owen Rambow (Columbia University)
    Chair 4	        TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service)
    Chair 5	        TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service)
    Chair 6	        TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service)
    Chair 7	        TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service)
    Chair 8	        TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service)
    Bibtex URL	    http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1%03d

**The correct value** for `Bibtex URL` can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x1RtUjAy-S_YhvTXWTrUc5xs9_4HkF0pOGynhRE963M/edit?usp=sharing).

The `Bibtex URL` uses **8** characters to identify the conference/workshop and paper, after the `http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/` prefix.  **You must make sure that the Bibtex URL provides for these 8 characters**. 

   For example, in an ACL main event in year 2017 (long papers, short papers, demos, student research workshop), the 8 characters will begin with `P17-`.  This stands for "ACL, 2017". For a workshop in year 2017, the 8 characters will begin with `W17-`.  This stands for "Workshop, 2017".  

**Add %03d or %02d, depending on how many characters are remaining to add the paper IDs and make up the full 8 characters.  %03d specifies 3 digits, %02d specificies 2 digits**.  The first values after the hyphen identify the workshop or ACL event.
The remaining values specify the paper ID. 

   For example, by specifying http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1%03d, we can create, e.g., http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1000.pdf.  
For workshops, we provide you with enough prefix that you need to specify just %02d additional following digits.  For example, if you're the 5th workshop listed, your bibtex URL will look like this: 

    Bibtex URL	    http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-05%02d
    

## Step 6:  Program Tab
[Jump to Step 7](#step-7--toc-tab)

   (may be able to skip)
   ![alt text](howto_images/program.png "The Program Tab.")

Customize your book proceedings Program `program.tex` here.  This is generated automatically in the Templates tab, when you click the  `Program` button.  See [Step Four](#step-4--templates-tab).


## Step 7:  Toc Tab
[Jump to Step 8](#step-8--generate-tab-trophy-trophy)

   (may be able to skip)
   ![alt text](howto_images/toc.png "The Table of Contents Tab.")

Customize your `toc.tex` here.  This is generated automatically in the Templates Tab, when you click the `Toc` Button.  See [Step Four](#step-4--templates-tab).


## Step 8:  Generate! Tab :trophy: :trophy:


   ![alt text](howto_images/generate.png "The Generate Tab.") 
   
Push these buttoms, top to bottom, in order.   If one of them doesn't compile, check out the error log to see why and debug.

The `Draft` option will show you how everything lines up with measurements -- use this to check the proceedings.  In addition to general checks on quality, you can also check if everything is within the given margins printed in this draft.

Once you can compile `All` without errors, you are done! :balloon: :balloon:

The `cdrom` directory in the full compiled proceedings can be used to create the Online Proceedings, with the program (`program.html`), authors (`authors.html`), and home page (`index.html`).  These are built with the proceedings generator using the Headers content exposed in [Step 4: Templates](#step-4--templates-tab).

## What to Look Out For

### Paper formatting

Please make sure that all of your papers meet the camera-ready standards as laid
out <a href="camera-ready-faq.html">in this document</a>. In particular, there are four main
areas of compliance you should look for:

1. *Margins*. Papers should fit entirely within the margins prescribed by the
   conference booklet. The [ACLPUB HOWTO ADDENDUM](aclpub-howto-2017.html)
   provides detailed instructions on how to adjust
   margin offsets for papers that need to be shifted.

1.  *Black & White readability*. Papers can contain color images, charts, and
    figures, but they should all be interpretable when printed or viewed in grayscale.

1. *References*. Please make sure there are no obvious problems with the formatting of
   the References section.
   
1. *Metadata*. Please make sure there are no obvious problems with the
   formatting of names in the metadata for each paper (which is
   viewable from the proceedings draft index). In particular, authors
   should be aware that their names
   [will be formatted according to how they have entered it](camera-ready-faq.html#name-formatting)
   on their Softconf unified user info page.

### Schedules

You will need to produce a schedule for your workshop/session while
generating the proceedings.  **The schedule deadline is the same as
the book deadline!** Please follow the instructions in this document, or take a look at this
[sample order file from SSST-7](files/sample-order.txt). 
Schedules are built from the proceedings `order` file, which you can either
edit manually in START's provided textbox or which you can create with the Excel-based `Schedule Maker` tool.

See the [Order](#step-3--order-tab) section above for more.
