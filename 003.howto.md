## ACLPUB HOWTO: Putting Together an ACL Proceedings Volume using START V2

### Who Should Read This Document

This guide to the `aclpub` software will help you create a single proceedings volume for an ACL-affiliated conference. Presumably, you are one of the following:

*   the program chair of a workshop
*   the program chair of the short paper, poster, and/or demo session
*   the publications chair of the overall conference (who traditionally assembles the main proceedings)

In short, you are a "book chair." This document will assume that you are specifically the program chair of a workshop, since most workshops are run like this.
