## ACLPUB HOWTO: Putting Together an ACL Proceedings Volume using START V2

### Who Should Read This Document

This guide to the `aclpub` software will help you create a single proceedings volume for an ACL-affiliated conference. Presumably, you are one of the following:

*   the program chair of a workshop
*   the program chair of the short paper, poster, and/or demo session
*   the publications chair of the overall conference (who traditionally assembles the main proceedings)

In short, you are a "book chair." This document will assume that you are specifically the program chair of a workshop, since most workshops are run like this.

<font size="-1">_Note:_ For our purposes, the student research workshop and the short paper session are considered to be separate logical books, even though they may be physically bound together (along with tutorial program info) into a single "companion volume."</font>

### Overview

We have tried to automate the process as much as possible. However, it still requires manual input. You should allocate 2-3 hours for this process. **The final look of your proceedings is your responsibility!**

By following these instructions, you will produce the following:

*   a single `book.pdf` file that contains your entire proceedings volume. The volume will then be professionally printed and also distributed as a PDF file on the conference CD-ROM. It is meant to look good both when printed and when viewed in a browser onscreen during the conference.

    In brief, the scripts use the LaTeX `pdfpages` package to combine all the papers plus front matter (title pages, tables of contents, etc.) into a single PDF file. Page numbers and citation/copyright information are automatically "stamped" onto the included papers. Papers with incorrect margins are shifted vertically at your discretion. The workshop program, the table of contents, and the author index are produced almost automatically and contain clickable hyperlinks for the reader's convenience.

*   a `spine.ps` file for the binding of the printed volume.

*   a `cdrom` directory that will be included on the conference CD-ROM. This contains HTML web pages, modfied PDF and PostScript versions of the individual papers, and BibTeX bibliography entries.

*   a `copyright-signatures` file with electronic signatures from the authors. This will be sent to the ACL main office.

*   an `advertisement.html` webpage that you, or the conference webmaster, can use to advertise your program in advance.

*   a few auxiliary data files that will be used again by the publications chair to produce other material for the CD-ROM (e.g., a consolidated [BibTeX database](http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/research/clgroup/aclbib/) and a consolidated author index) and the online [ACL Anthology](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology).

Here is a flowchart to illustrate the process. You will be using the START V2 ACLPUB Tool, which is a wrapper over the original ACLPUB scripts. The ACLPUB scripts used makefiles that followed the steps in this flowchart, and most operations had to be carried out manually.

Please note that you do not need to know about makefiles and Linux to run the proceedings generation. Almost everything is available from the various tabs of the START V2 ACLPUB tool.

If you still want to hand tune the result via the legacy ACLPUB scripts, you can download the package and install it on your machine. Then you can use the final submission zip archive file as input to the old ACLPUB scripts, and generate your proceedings. However, this method is not recommended.

### Who's Responsible

*   **If you have trouble figuring out how to use the scripts,** ask the publications chair for help.

*   **If you think there is something wrong with the scripts, or have constructive comments,** email the publications chairs.

*   **If you want to improve the scripts or documentation**, you can download the ACLPUB scripts produced by START as a zip file, and send patches to the SoftConf team for integration.

_Acknowledgments:_ The aclpub package and documentation were built in 2005 by Jason Eisner and Philipp Koehn, based in part on scripts by David Yarowsky that had been used for several years previously.

### Setting up the Final submission page to collect the Camera ready papers

When you need to start collecting the camera-ready papers for your conference or workshop, you need to create a **Custom Final Submission Page**. To do that, you need to go in the _Manager Console_, then to the _Custom Submission Page Editor_.

First of all, please check that a final page for your publication does not already exist. If you are running a workshop, in fact, it may be that the Softconf people already populated an ACLPUB final submission page for you.

If a final submission page is not yet available, please create one by clicking on the _New Page_ tab, using the "-- (ACLPUB Final Submission template) --". Please edit all the copyright information and the additional text as you wish. You may add additional textboxes, selectors, and the like to collect more information if needed.

When you are satisfied with the final submission page, you need to make it visible by activating it. To activate it, please go in the Manager Console, then _Visibility/Phasing/Deadlines_. Make the page the only one visible for **Revision**, and be sure to set a reasonable **deadline** for the page.

To test if the page works properly, you need to try it using the passcode of an accepted paper. To get the passcode, you can use the Spreadsheet Maker in the Manager Console.
