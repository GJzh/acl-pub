<h2>ACLPUB HOWTO: Putting Together an ACL Proceedings Volume using START V2</h2>

<h3>Who Should Read This Document</h3>

<p>This guide to the <code>aclpub</code> software will help you create
a single proceedings volume for an ACL-affiliated conference.
Presumably, you are one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the program chair of a workshop
  <li>the program chair of the short paper, poster, and/or demo session
  <li>the publications chair of the overall conference (who
  traditionally assembles the main proceedings)
</ul>

<p>In short, you are a "book chair."  This document will assume that
you are specifically the program chair of a workshop, since most
workshops are run like this.</p>

<p><font size=-1><i>Note:</i> For our purposes, the student research workshop and
the short paper session are considered to be separate logical books,
even though they may be physically bound together (along with tutorial
program info) into a single "companion volume."</font></p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>We have tried to automate the process as much as possible.
However, it still requires manual input.  You should allocate 2-3
hours for this process.  <b>The final look of your proceedings is your
responsibility!</b></p>

<p>By following these instructions, you will produce the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>a single <code>book.pdf</code> file that contains your entire
  proceedings volume.  The volume will then be professionally printed
  and also distributed as a PDF file on the conference CD-ROM.  It is
  meant to look good both when printed and when viewed in a browser onscreen during
  the conference.</p>

  <p>In brief, the scripts use the LaTeX <code>pdfpages</code> package
  to combine all the papers plus front matter (title pages, tables of contents, etc.)
  into a single PDF file.
  Page numbers and citation/copyright information are automatically
  "stamped" onto the included papers.  Papers with incorrect margins are
  shifted vertically at your discretion.  The workshop program, the
  table of contents, and the author index are produced almost
  automatically and contain clickable hyperlinks for the reader's
  convenience.</p>

  <li><p>a <code>spine.ps</code> file for the binding of the printed
  volume.

  <li><p>a <code>cdrom</code> directory that will be included on the
  conference CD-ROM.  This contains HTML web pages, modfied PDF and
  PostScript versions of the individual papers, and BibTeX
  bibliography entries.</p>

  <li><p>a <code>copyright-signatures</code> file with electronic
  signatures from the authors.  This will be sent to the ACL main
  office.</p>

  <li><p>an <code>advertisement.html</code> webpage that you, or 
  the conference webmaster, can use to advertise your program in
  advance.</p>

  <li><p>a few auxiliary data files that will be used again by the
  publications chair to produce other material for the CD-ROM (e.g.,
  a consolidated <a
  href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/research/clgroup/aclbib/">BibTeX
  database</a> and a consolidated author index)
  and the online <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology">ACL
  Anthology</a>.</p>
  
</ul>

<p>Here is a flowchart to illustrate the process.  You will
be using the START V2 ACLPUB Tool, 
which is a wrapper over the original 
ACLPUB scripts. The ACLPUB scripts used 
makefiles that followed the steps in this flowchart, and most
operations had to be carried out manually.

<p>Please note that you do not need to know about makefiles and Linux to run the proceedings generation. Almost everything is available from the various tabs of the START V2 ACLPUB tool.</p>

<p>If you still want to hand tune the result via the legacy ACLPUB scripts,
you can download the package and install it on your machine.
Then you can use the final submission zip archive file as input to the old
ACLPUB scripts, and generate your proceedings.  However, this method is not
recommended.</p>

<h3>Who's Responsible</h3>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>If you have trouble figuring out how to use the
scripts,</b> ask the publications chair for help.</p>

  <li><p><b>If you think there is something wrong with the scripts, or have
  constructive comments,</b> email the publications chairs.</p>
  
  <li><p><b>If you want to improve the scripts or documentation</b>, you can
  download the ACLPUB scripts produced by START as a zip file, and send patches to the SoftConf team for integration.</p>
</ul>
  
<p><i>Acknowledgments:</i> The aclpub package and documentation were
built in 2005 by Jason Eisner and Philipp Koehn, based in part on
scripts by David Yarowsky that had been used for several years
previously.</p>

<h3>Setting up the Final submission page to collect the Camera ready papers</h3>
<p>When you need to start collecting the camera-ready papers for your
conference or workshop, you need to create a <b>Custom Final
Submission Page</b>. To do that, you need to go in the <i>Manager
Console</i>, then to the <i>Custom Submission Page Editor</i>.</p>

<p>First of all, please check that a final page for your publication
does not already exist. If you are running a workshop, in fact, it may
be that the Softconf people already populated an ACLPUB final
submission page for you.</p>

<p>If a final submission page is not yet available, please create one
by clicking on the <i>New Page</i> tab, using the "-- (ACLPUB Final
Submission template) --". Please edit all the copyright information
and the additional text as you wish. You may add additional textboxes,
selectors, and the like to collect more information if needed.</p>

<p>When you are satisfied with the final submission page, you need to make it visible by activating it. To activate it, please go in the Manager Console, then <i>Visibility/Phasing/Deadlines</i>. 
Make the page the only one visible for <b>Revision</b>, and be sure to 
set a reasonable <b>deadline</b> for the page.</p>

<p>To test if the page works properly, you need to try it using the passcode of an accepted paper. To get the passcode, you can use the Spreadsheet Maker in the Manager Console.</p>

<h3>Check Copyright Signatures</h3>

<p>Your first job is to check that your authors signed their copyright
forms via START.  To create the <code>copyright-signatures</code>
file, go on the <b>Generate tab</b>, and click on the <b>Copyright
Signatures</b> button.</p>

<p>After pressing the button, the page will be reloaded, and you will
  have three links next to the button:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>zip</b>: this enables you to download a copy of the ACLPUB scripts used to generate the specific target (in this case, the Copyright signatures). You can use it to remake the proceedings generation using the original ACLPUB scripts without using the START integration. </li>
  <li> <b>log</b>: this is a text file containing the execution log of the ACLPUB scripts. If something does not work, this is the place to look at for an error in the scripts. </li>
  <li> <b>Download</b>: when the generation is succesfull, you can use this link to donload the product of the generation. In this case, you can use it to download the Copyright Signatures.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, click on the "Download copyright signatures" link to
download the copyright signatures.</p>

<p>DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE; it is a legal record.  Please review it ASAP
to make sure that appropriate signatures have been provided for all
papers.  Then email it to the publications chair, pointing out any
papers with missing or inappropriate signatures (e.g., "Mickey
Mouse").  You or the publications chair will need to extract <a
href="http://www.aclweb.org/acl2005/pubs/copyright">hardcopy
signatures</a> from those papers' authors in time for their papers to
be included.</p>

<p>If you did not use START to gather the papers, you will need to get
hardcopy forms from your authors.  See our <a
href="http://www.aclweb.org/acl2005/pubs/copyright">copyright
webpage</a> and contact the publications chairs.</p>

<h3>Create Metadata</h3>

<p>Almost all the data about the papers will be maintained in a file
called <code>db</code> (for "database").  The metadata file does not
need to be generated. START will generate it and use it when
needed.</p>

<!-- <p>If you did use START, but want to add additional papers (invited talk
abstracts, shared task descriptions, ...), then you can add entries
to the <code>db</code> file similarly.</p>-->

<p><font color="magenta">Make sure to get the Page number fields
right.  At present, the Page number field in a <code>db</code> entry
is only checked against the actual paper length.  You will not get a
second warning if you don't fix it, or fix it incorrectly, or create
the <code>db</code> file manually without help from START.</font></p>

<p>To check the paper length, you can go into the <b>Margins tab</b>,
and check the <b>Page #</b> column. If an author declared a page
number different from what START can find, you will get an error
message there.</p>

<p>Most of the times, <b>the page number error message is due to the
fact that the uploaded PDF does not have embedded fonts</b>. If that
is the case, please download the paper, print it again using a PDF
printer (like Acrobat Distiller, Bullzip, or similar), check if the
paper has the embedded fonts in it, and if so upload again the
paper.</p>

<h3>Get Rough Cut</h3>

<p>Please go in the Generate Tab, and <b>click on the Draft
button</b>. The command extracts the first two pages from each paper
and adds margin markings and generates a first rough cut of the
proceedings, <code>book.pdf</code>.</p>

<p>Use then the link <b>Download Draft</b> to download the Rough Cut.

<p>The rough cut is not a full volume yet (e.g., no author index,
and only the first couple of pages of each paper will be present).
But it will reveal a number of potential problems in the automatically
produced <code>db</code> file or the submitted PDF files.</p>

<h3>Use Rough Cut to Check and Fix the PDF files</h3>

<p>Flip through the rough cut.  Do all the fonts in the papers display
and print correctly?  If not, you will need to ask the author to email
you a corrected version of the PDF file. 
<p>

<p>The publications chair has probably put up a webpage with
instructions for authors, based on the version at
<code>.../aclpub/doc/authors</code>.  Remind the author to consult
that page.</p>

<p>Also ask the author for the LaTeX or Word sources, so that you can
produce the corrected PDF file yourself on your machine, if
necessary.</p>

There are a few common problems:<p></p>

<ul>
  <li><p>The paper uses the wrong overall font.  Typically, the
author didn't start his or her LaTeX file with</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{times}</pre>
  </blockquote>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>Asian fonts don't display correctly or cause the PDF viewer
  to report an error.  In this case, the author will need to produce a
  new version of the
  PDF file, with Asian fonts embedded.<br>
  <br>
  As an aid to detecting papers that have not correctly embedded Asian fonts, you can use the &quot;make cdrom&quot; command. One aspect of this process is the production of the cdrom/ps directory. As pdf files are converted to ps format and placed in that directory, diagnostic messages regarding fonts will be generated by the pdftops command.<br>
  <br>
  In particular the following warnings may appear when processing papers by authors from Japan:<br>
  <br>
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Error: Unknown character collection 'Adobe-Japan1'<br>
  Error: Couldn't find a font to substitute for 'Ryumin-Light-Identity-H' ('Adobe-Japan1' character collection)<br>
  Error: Couldn't find a font to substitute for 'GothicBBB-Medium-Identity-H' ('Adobe-Japan1' character collection)</font></p>
    <p>Also, the following warnings may appear when processing papers by authors from China:<br>
      <br>
      <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Error: Unknown character collection 'Adobe-GB1'<br>
      Error: Couldn't find 'GBK-EUC-H' CMap file for 'Adobe-GB1' collection<br>
      Error: Unknown CMap 'GBK-EUC-H' for character collection 'Adobe-GB1'<br>
      Error: Unknown font tag 'F1' </font></p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>A paper's individual camera-ready PDF file looks okay when
  viewed alone, but when it appears as part of <code>book.pdf</code>,
  there is too much space between the letters.</p>

  <p>We are not sure why this occasionally happens.  But we suspect that
  it is a problem with embedded fonts.  The solution is to recreate
  the paper's PDF file with a more up-to-date version of
  <code>pdflatex</code>.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Very occasionally, a bad paper may cause
  acroread to crash.  Try to isolate the bad paper by viewing
  the individually submitted PDF files in the <code>final</code>
  directory, and contact the author.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Most of the times, the PDF error message is due to the fact that
    the uploaded PDF does not have embedded fonts. If that is the
    case, please download the paper, print it again using a PDF
    printer (like Acrobat Distiller, Bullzip, or similar), check if
    the paper has the embedded fonts in it, and if so upload again the
    paper.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Rough Cut to Check and Fix the paper information</h3>

<p>Now you will check that the information provided by authors and
inserted in the metadata file in the <code>db</code> are correct and
correctly formatted.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Count the papers to make sure you're not missing any (e.g., due to an 
  author's failure to submit camera-ready copy).</p>
  
  </li><li><p>For each paper in the rough cut, check that
  the <code>db</code> information (which was supplied by the author
  when submitting the camera-ready paper) really matches the
  author/title on the actual camera-ready paper.  If not, go in the
  Margins tab, and edit the paper information using the final
  submission page link.</p>
  
  </li><li><p>Capitalization of authors should be as in BibTeX.  Example:</p>
  
  <blockquote><pre>
Piet Q. van Oostrum, Jr.
  </pre></blockquote>
  
  </li><li>Check the author index at the end of the rough cut to make
  sure that you don't have separate entries for "Doe, Jane" and
  "Doe, J."  That is, if the same author contributed to multiple
  papers, make sure his or her name is written the same way each
  time in the various paper information.</li>
  
  <li><p>Capitalization of titles should be exactly as in BibTeX,
  since these data will be used to create public BibTeX files for use
  by anyone.</p>
  
  <p>BibTeX format is designed to provide enough information for
  BibTeX to use any capitalization style as directed.  The proceedings
  program and table of contents will use the default BibTeX
  conventions almost directly.  However, the information in
  your <code>db</code> file will also be turned into public BibTeX
  entries that can be used by anyone, with any bibliographic
  style.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  
  <blockquote><pre>
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: A Mixed-Case Guide to Capitalization in {BibTeX}
    </pre></blockquote>
  
  <p>Specifically:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Always capitalize the first word of the title, and any word
    following a colon.

    </li><li>Except as above, lowercase the following "little words":
    articles, prepositions, coordinating conjunctions, and the
    infinitive marker "to."

    </li><li>Capitalize all content words.  This includes hyphenated words:
    <code>Mixed-Case</code>.
    
    </li><li>If a content word is inherently capitalized and must retain
    capitalization even in a lowercase style (such as ACL's prescribed style
    <code>acl.bst</code>), "protect" it by
    surrounding at least the capital letters with curly braces:
    <code>{E}nglish</code>, <code>{C}homsky</code>,
    <code>{IBM}</code>, <code>{CFG}s</code>, <code>{HMM}s</code> (or
    if you prefer, <code>{English}</code>, <code>{Chomsky}</code>,
    <code>{IBM}</code>, <code>{CFGs}</code>, <code>{HMMs}</code>).

    </li><li>Use LaTeX math mode where appropriate: <code>An $O(n^2)$
    Algorithm for $n$-gram Smoothing</code>.

    </li><li>Use <a href="http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/teTeX/latex/latex2e-html/ltx-401.html">LaTeX
    commands for accents</a>.</li>

  </ul>

  <p><font color="magenta">In future, correcting the bibtex
  capitalization should be attempted first by a
  script.  Protected words could be found by simple corpus analysis
  (e.g., from the submitted papers themselves).</font></p>
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Use Rough Cut to Check and Adjust Margins</h3>

<p>If you are satisfied with author and title information after making
appropriate changes in the information entered for each paper, regenerate the rough
cut, by again clicking on the Draft button</p>

<p>The top/bottom margins of the paper are very often wrong.
Unfortunately we have not yet found an automatic method to fix this.
However, we have made it relatively easy for you to fix manually.</p>

<p>The rough-cut version of <code>book.pdf</code> includes a margin
frame and rulers that should make it easy to detect how much each
paper must be shifted to fit. Each paper is also stamped with its
submission ID.</p>

<p>Look especially at page 2 of each paper.  If the text doesn't fit
within the frame, look at the top of the text to see how many
millimeters it should be moved, and add a margin specification to the
specific paper. To add the margin to a paper, go in the Margins tab, and click on the yellow box in the Margins column. The format of the line is</p>

<blockquote><pre>
x-axis-movement y-axis-movement[,more-options]
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Positive values move up and to the right.  Negative values move
down and to the left.  For example, if the top of the text is
<code>14mm</code> below the top of the frame, according to the ruler,
then enter the values <code>0 14</code>.</p>

Common values are:
<blockquote><pre>
0 6
0 -12
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Horizontal correction is rarely needed.  In an exceptional case,
you may need to shrink a page or clip it against a specified bounding
box or something.  You can do this by appending some options that will
be passed to the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/grfguide.pdf">LaTeX
includegraphics command</A>, which slurps in the page as a graphical
object:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
0 6,scale=0.95
0 10,bb=0 90 612 792,clip
</pre></blockquote>

<p>After entering the margin movement information, you can regenerate
the rough cut (just click on the Draft button again) and check that
everything is at the right place.  Iterate until convergence.</p>

<h3>Set Schedule (or at least order of papers)</h3>

<p>In an ACL proceedings, papers should be ordered chronologically by
their time in the program.  This makes the proceedings volume useful
at the conference itself.</p>

<p>To specify the order to be used, you need to go in the <b>order tab</b>. From that tab, you will be able to select if you want the Order tab to be automatically generated from the information contained in the Schedule Maker, or if you want to use the ACLPUB format for the <tt>order</tt> file.

<h4>Using the Schedule Maker to get the order</h4>

<blockquote>
Go to  the Manager  console, then  on the Schedule  Maker, and  fill a
schedule for  your papers.  The ACLPUB script  will make usage  of the
Days, Sections, Paper, and Generic items entries.</p>

<p> <b>Events that do not correspond to papers</b>: Breaks, opening remarks, invited talks, panel discussions, awards, etc. For each such event, you should add a Generic Item in the schedule. You can insert a Generic itemthe generic items by editing the XML file generated by the schedule maker and using the latest four columns. If the keynote speech appears in the schedule with a page describing the abstract of the Keynote, then you need to do the following: 
<ul>
<li> Add a separate paper to the system. You can do that from the manager console, "Make a New Submission". 
<li> Accept the paper in order for it to appear in the schedule.
<li> Submit the final material for the special event, as done for regolar submissions
<li> Edit the schedule to place the keynote in the right place in the schedule.
</ul>

<p>The timing of breaks may be coordinated across all the workshops
  on a given day.  This allows participants from different workshops
  to mingle over shared snacks.  <b>Please consult the workshops chair
    when deciding when to place your breaks.</b></p>

<p>Once you have edited the Schedule using the Schedule Maker, you can again click on the Draft button.

<p>You are free to edit the information about the paper and the
schedule whenever you want.
</blockquote>

<h4>Using the ACLPUB format to enter the order</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Your first step is to create a draft <code>order</code> file from
the current <code>db</code>.  To do this, click on one of the two "Import" buttons in the Order tab.

<p>Here (roughly) is the start of the draft <code>order</code> file
generated for the ACL 2005 main conference:</p>

<blockquote><pre>

<p>The <code>order</code> file can contain these kinds of lines:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p><b>Comments:</b> Anything following <code>"#"</code> on a line
  will be ignored by the scripts.  
  

  </p></li><li><p><b>Scheduled papers:</b> A typical line contains a paper
  number followed by a timeslot.   (An optional comment indicates
  the first author and title, for your convenience.)</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><p><b>Unscheduled papers:</b> You may omit a paper's timeslot
  (e.g., in a poster session where the posters run in parallel).  The
  paper ID is enough.  Remember that the order of papers in the
  <code>order</code> file will determine the order in the
  proceedings.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Days:</b> At the start of each day of the workshop (even if
  there is only one day), add a line beginning
  with <code>*</code> such as:</p>
  
  <blockquote><pre>
* Sunday, June 26, 2005
  </pre></blockquote>
  </li>

  <li><p><b>Session titles:</b> The workshop may be broken up into several
  sessions. For each session title add a line beginning with <code>=</code> such as:</p>

  <blockquote><pre>

  </pre></blockquote>
  </li>

  <li><p><b>Events that do not correspond to papers:</b>
  Breaks, opening remarks, invited talks, panel discussions, awards,
  etc.  For each such event, add a line beginning with <code>+</code>
  such as:</p>

  <blockquote><pre>
+ 9:00--10:00 Invited Talk by Justine Cassell
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>The timing of breaks may be coordinated across all the workshops
  on a given day.  This allows participants from different workshops
  to mingle over shared snacks.  <b>Please consult the workshops chair
  when deciding when to place your breaks.</b></p>
  
  </li>

</ul>

<p>Once you have edited the Schedule using the Schedule Maker, you can again click on the Draft button.

<p>You are free to edit the information about the paper and the
schedule whenever you want.

</blockquote>


<h3>Recreate the Proceedings</h3>

<p>Once you're satisfied  with the rough cut, have a  look at what the
final proceedings  will look like,  by clicking on  the <b>Shipout</b>
button.</p>

<p>You can use both the Draft and the Shipout buttons as you
like. When generating the files, each button works on a separate
working directory, and the generations are done independently.</p>

<h3>Edit Workshop-Specific Pages</h3>

<p>A number of <code>*.tex</code> files now have to be manually edited
for workshop-specific information.</p>

<p>To edit them, you have two ways: You can edit the files directly on
the web page, in the <b>Templates tab</b>, or you can download and
upload them in batch in the <b>Downl Tmpl</b> tab.


<ul>

  <li><p>Edit your workshop title and date
  in <code>titlepage.tex</code>.  This will appear on the title page
  and the workshop cover.  You can click on the <b>Titlepage</b>
  button on the Templates tab to see quickly what just this page will
  look like.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Add the logos of your sponsors (if you have any) to the start
  of the proceedings, by editing <code>copyright.tex</code>.  You can
  click on the <b>Copyright</b> button on the Templates tab to see
  quickly what just this page will look like.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Add your preface by editing <code>preface.tex</code>.  You can
  click on the <b>Preface</b> button on the Templates tab to see
  quickly what just this page will look like.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Add contributors' names by
  editing <code>organizers.tex</code>.  You can click on
  the <b>Organizers</b> button on the Templates tab to see quickly
  what just this page will look like.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Fix any ugly page breaks in <code>program.tex</code> and
  <code>toc.tex</code>.  You can edit the two files in the <b>Program
  tab</b>. Note taht to use the modified files, you need to check the
  appropriate checkbox in the Generate tab. You can click on
  the <b>Program</b> and <b>Toc</b> button on the Templates tab to see
  quickly what just this page will look like.  </p></li>
  
  <li><p>You will have noticed that citation information is stamped at
  the bottom of the first page of every paper.  Edit the
  <code>	teinfo</code> command in <code>citation-stamp.tex</code> in the Templates/Settings tab to reflect
  how your workshop should properly be cited.  In particular, be
  sure to change the title.   </p></li>

  <li><p>Edit the PDF metadata in <code>book.tex</code>.  (This will
  appear in the PDF "Document Properties" of the online
  proceedings.)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>edit "pdftitle" field to reflect proceedings title.</li>
    
    <li>optionally edit "pdfauthor" field to include name of your SIG.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li><p>While not usually necessary, you can edit
  <code>allpapers.tex</code> to fine-tune the treatment
  of individual papers: how they are
  citation-stamped, indexed in the Author Index, graphically included via <A
  HREF="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages/pdfpages.pdf"><code>includepdf</code></A>,
  etc.</p></li>

</ul>

<h4>How to add logos and pictures to the template files cited above</h4>

You can completely customize the templates directory adding new
pictures.

To add new pictures, and in general to add separate files to the
templates, you can do the following steps:

<ul>
<li> First, download the templates zip file from the "Dwnl templates" tab
<li> Then, add the image in PDF format to the unpacked archive.
<li> After that, you need to include the image in the latex files. To
  do that, you can do the following:
  <ul>
    <li> in the initial part, before <tt>\begin{document}</tt>,
      include the line <br>
      <tt>\usepackage{graphicx}</tt>
    <li> in the point where the figure needs to appear, use the
      following code:<br>
      <tt>\includegraphics{../templates/<i>imagename</i>.pdf}</tt><br>
      where <tt>../templates/</tt> is needed because the <tt>make</tt>
      command is not run in the <tt>templates</tt> directory (where
      the image is stored).
  </ul>
</ul>


<h3>Final Onscreen Check</h3>

Regenerate the proceedings, and continue to edit the <code>.tex</code> files until
everything looks good by clicking on the <b>Shipout button</b>.

<p>Make sure that all names are spelled correctly, etc.</p>

<p>Just in case, check the following production issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>The first paper should start on an odd page.  That is,
  page 1 should correspond to an odd-numbered page of the full PDF file,
  so that it appears on the right side in the printed volume.  (This
  is supposed to be arranged automatically by <code>isodd</code>
  macros in <code>book.tex</code>.)

  <li><p>There should be red hyperlinks in the table of contents, program,
  and author index, as well as "bookmarks" at the left of
  the PDF window.  All of these should work when clicked.
  <font color="magenta">In future, it would be nice to have
  hierarchical bookmarks grouped by session.</font></p>

  <li><p>The first page of <i>every</i> paper should have a citation
  stamped below the page number.  This may occasionally be cut off
  (for completely bitmapped papers).  Contact the publications chairs
  for a short-term fix. <font color="magenta">There exists a long-term
  fix for next year.</font></p>

</ul>

<h3>Final Printed Check</h3>

<p>Try printing the PDF file on a black-and-white Postscript printer.
Just because everything works onscreen does not guarantee that it will
work in the printout.</p>

<p>Make sure everything looks fine onscreen and prints fine!  Look
through the online and printed proceedings carefully.  It is the
responsibility of the workshop chair to make sure that everything is
correct.</p>

<h3>Create a Spine Text for the Proceedings</h3>

<p>Edit the file <code>spine.tex</code> in the Templates/Settings tab
to reflect the text that you want to appear on the binding of the
volume.  (<i>Note:</i> If the volume is too thin to support spine
text, this file will be ignored.)</p>

<p>Now click on the <b>Spine</b> button in the Generate tab to chheck the result.
</p>

<h3>Make Your CD-ROM Directory</h3>

<p>Now it's time to build your contribution to the CD-ROM, including
HTML pages and BibTeX entries.  For this, you will need to edit all the fields in the <b>CDROM tab</b>

<p>Contact the publications chair for the correct value of the about
the Bibtex URL field for <b>your</b> workshop.  This
determines its permament URL in the ACL Anthology.</p>

<p>To create the cdrom directory, click on the <b>All button</b> in the Generate tab.

<p>The button also creates an advertisement webpage for your workshop (basically a
copy of <code>cdrom/program.html</code> that has been stripped of
actual links to the papers).</p>

<h3>Wrap Everything Up and Send It Off!</h3>

<p>Click on the <b>All button</b> in the Generate tab.

<p>This will check that everything is up to date, and package up your
<code>proceedings</code> directory as a tarball file
<code><code>proceedings.tgz</code> in the parent directory.</p>

<p>Send <code>../proceedings.tgz</code> by the deadline to the
publications chair.  Use an email attachment if necessary, but it
would be nicer just to email an <code>http:</code> or
<code>ftp:</code> URL where the <code>proceedings.tgz</code> file can
be downloaded.  </p>

<p>While we want the whole tarball so that we can rerun the scripts in
case of problems, it is especially essential that we receive:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>book.pdf</code>, the proceedings</li>
  <li><code>db</code>, the reordered database file</li>
  <li><code>final.tgz</code>, the PDF files of the papers and metadata</li>
  <li><code>citation-stamp.tex</code>, the template for the citation text stamped on each paper
  <li><code>spine.ps</code>, the spine</li>
  <li><code>copyright-signatures</code>, the file with the copyright signatures</li>
  <li>anything that should go on the CD in addition to the papers</li>
</ul>

<p>That is, the best thing to send is the <b>zip file</b> resulted
from the click on the <b>All button</b>.

<p>Congratulations and <b>thank you</b>!</p>
