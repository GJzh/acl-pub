<h1>How to produce proceedings for the NAACL 2013</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <p>
      This page is for conference organizers (main conference, workshop &amp; demo chairs) who need
      to put together a book for inclusion in the NAACL proceedings. The book deadline is <b>May 5</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>
      You should be able to produce your proceedings entirely within the START manager console.
      The relevant page for producing the book is found under the Conference Program heading,
      following the <b>ACLPUB</b> link. From there, instructions on book assembly can be found under
      the Instructions tab, and by reading the 
      <a href="http://nlp.csie.ncnu.edu.tw/~shin/acl2010/publication/howto/aclpub/ACLPUB.START.2.htm">
        ACLPUB HOWTO</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your book builds without error using the <b>All</b> button under the Generate tab,
      let the publications chairs know by e-mailing us at
      <a href="mailto:naacl-2013-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com">naacl-2013-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com</a>.
      We will collect the books online using START. There is no need to e-mail us any zipped files.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will update this page periodically with NAACL2013-specific details and answers to frequently
      asked questions as they arise.
    </p>

    <h2>Details and Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h4>Paper formatting</h4>

    Please make sure that all of your papers meet the camera-ready standards as laid
    out <a href="camera-ready-faq.htmL">in this document</a>. In particular, there are four main
    areas of compliance you should look for:

    <ol>
      <li><i>Margins</i>. Papers should fit entirely within the margins prescribed by the
        conference booklet. The ACLPUB HOWTO provides detailed instructions on how to provide
        margin offsets for papers that need to be shifted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Black &amp; White readability</i>. Papers can contain color images, charts, and
        figures, but they should all be interpretable when printed or viewed in grayscale.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>References</i>. Please make sure there are no obvious problems with the formatting of
        the References section.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Metadata</i>. Please make sure there are no obvious problems with the formatting of
        names in the metadata for each paper (which is viewable from the proceedings draft
        index). In particular, authors should be aware that their
        names <a href="camera-ready-faq.html#name-formatting">will be formatted according to how
          they have entered it</a> on their Softconf unified user info page.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Schedules</h4>

    <p>
      You will need to produce a schedule for your workshop while generating the proceedings.
      <b>The schedule deadline is the same as the book deadline!</b>
      Please follow the instructions in the ACLPUB HOWTO.
      Note that we recommend you use the <code>order</code> file method to produce your schedule;
      it is often simpler than the Schedule Maker. One possible work sequence is as follows:
      <ol>
        <li> 
          Generate an initial order file from the Order tab <br>(<b>Import from ScheduleMaker</b> works even if you have not used Schedule Maker) </br>
        </li>
        <li> 
          Copy it to a local text editor, edit it appopriately 
        </li>
        <li> 
          Paste it back into the <code>order</code> window and save 
        </li>
      </ol>
