<h1>How to produce proceedings for NAACL 2013</h1>

<div class="row">
    <p>
      This page is for conference organizers (main conference, workshop &amp; demo chairs) who need
      to put together a book for inclusion in the NAACL proceedings. The book deadline is <b>May 5</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>
      You should be able to produce your proceedings entirely within the START manager console.
      The relevant page for producing the book is found under the Conference Program heading,
      following the <code>ACLPUB</code> link. From there, instructions on book assembly can be found under
      the Instructions tab, and by reading the 
      <a href="aclpub-howto-2010.html">ACLPUB HOWTO</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your book builds without error using the <code>All</code> button under the Generate tab,
      let the publications chairs know by e-mailing us at
      <a href="mailto:naacl-2013-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com">naacl-2013-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com</a>.
      We will collect the books online using START. There is no need to e-mail us any zipped files.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will update this page periodically with NAACL2013-specific details and answers to frequently
      asked questions as they arise. If you encounter any problems with this process, please 
      <a href="mailto:naacl-2013-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com">contact us</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Details and Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h4>Paper formatting</h4>

    Please make sure that all of your papers meet the camera-ready standards as laid
    out <a href="camera-ready-faq.html">in this document</a>. In particular, there are four main
    areas of compliance you should look for:

    <ol>
      <li><i>Margins</i>. Papers should fit entirely within the margins prescribed by the
        conference booklet. The 
        <a href="http://nlp.csie.ncnu.edu.tw/~shin/acl2010/publication/howto/aclpub/ACLPUB.START.2.htm">ACLPUB HOWTO</a> 
        provides detailed instructions on how to adjust
        margin offsets for papers that need to be shifted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Black &amp; White readability</i>. Papers can contain color images, charts, and
        figures, but they should all be interpretable when printed or viewed in grayscale.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>References</i>. Please make sure there are no obvious problems with the formatting of
        the References section.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Metadata</i>. Please make sure there are no obvious problems with the formatting of
        names in the metadata for each paper (which is viewable from the proceedings draft
        index). In particular, authors should be aware that their
        names <a href="camera-ready-faq.html#name-formatting">will be formatted according to how
          they have entered it</a> on their Softconf unified user info page.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Schedules</h4>

    <p>
      You will need to produce a schedule for your workshop/session while generating the proceedings.
      <b>The schedule deadline is the same as the book deadline!</b>
      Please follow the instructions in the 
      <a href="http://nlp.csie.ncnu.edu.tw/~shin/acl2010/publication/howto/aclpub/ACLPUB.START.2.htm">ACLPUB HOWTO</a>.
      We will build the conference handbook from the <code>order</code> file, which you can either create manually
      (or using a script you write yourself) or which can be created through START's <code>Schedule Maker</code>.
      One possible workflow would be:
      <ol>
        <li> 
          Generate an initial order file from the <code>Order</code> tab
          <br>(<code>Import from ScheduleMaker</code> works even if you have not yet used Schedule Maker)
        </li>
        <li> 
          Copy it to a local text editor, edit it appopriately 
        </li>
        <li> 
          Paste it back into the <code>order</code> window and save 
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h4>Important notes about the order file</h4>
    <p>The order file is used both to format and order the papers in the proceedings, and
      also to generate the handbook. The latter can be a complex task, making sure that 
      the schedule is formatted correctly and consistently, and pulling together times
      across workshops (like the student research workshop and the main proceedings). Since
      this is done in LaTeX, it's important that the schedules be formatted to be
      computer-readable. Here are some notes about the "order" file, including common
      mistakes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Times should be specified in 24-hour format (implicit AM/PM):

	<pre>+ 12:00--13:30 Lunch</pre>

      <li>Time ranges should be fully specified, with two dashes in
      between (and no spaces). Don't put just the start time.

	<pre>17 9:00--9:30 # A really great paper</pre>

      <li>Do not put time ranges in parentheses

      <li>Don't put time ranges in session headers. Incorrect:

	<p><b><font color="red">Incorrect</font></b>: 
	  <pre>= (9:10--11:00) Session 1</pre>
	Correct: 
	  <pre>= Session 1</code></pre>
    </ul>

    <h4>Copyright Page</h4>

    <p>
      We have taken the liberty of pre-populating the <code>copyright.tex</code> under <code>ACLPUB</code>'s
      <code>Templates->Sections</code> with the correct ISBN and ACL address.
      If you have workshop sponsors, you will still need to acknowledge your sponsors in 
      that file.
    </p>

    <h4>CDROM Tab</h4>
    <p>
      We have also pre-populated many of the fields under the top <code>CDROM</code> tab of the
      <code>ACLPUB</code> console. Only the <code>chair list</code> needs to be filled. Please 
      fill in the <code>chair list</code> yourselves and make adjustments as necessary to the 
      other fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>Bibtex URL</code> field has now been populated automatically. For your reference,
      a complete list of books and their corresponding URLs can be found <a href=bibtex.html>here.</a>
