    <p>
      This page is for conference organizers (main conference, workshop &amp; demo chairs) who need
      to put together a book for inclusion in the NAACL proceedings. The book deadline is <b>May 5</b>.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>
      You should be able to produce your proceedings entirely within the START manager console.
      The relevant page for producing the book is found under the Conference Program heading,
      following the <b>ACLPUB</b> link. From there, instructions on book assembly can be found under
      the Instructions tab, and by reading the 
      <a href="http://nlp.csie.ncnu.edu.tw/~shin/acl2010/publication/howto/aclpub/ACLPUB.START.2.htm">
        ACLPUB HOWTO</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your book builds without error using the <b>All</b> button under the Generate tab,
      let the publications chairs know by e-mailing us at
      <a href="mailto:naacl-2013-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com">naacl-2013-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com</a>.
      We will collect the books online using START. There is no need to e-mail us any zipped files.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will update this page periodically with NAACL2013-specific details and answers to frequently
      asked questions as they arise.
