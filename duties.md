### Some duties of pub chairs

We do these for main conference proceedings. The workshop chairs are
left to do it for their own workshops.

This should be done prior to submission of camera-readies.

- Send a note to authors outlining their main obligations for getting
  the paper ready
  
  - Ask them to use the NAACL ID lookup tool in listing authors

  - Remind them that their name formatting is taking from their
    account information
    
  - Ask them to be sure that figures are readable in B&W

  - Anything else?

After the camera-readies have been submitted.

- Validate and correct paper metadata

  - Make sure the papers fit within the proceedings margins
  
  - Make sure figures don't depend on color to convey information

  - Make sure the list of paper authors (this is only for the most
    thorough pub chairs!)

- Make sure all copyright and video release forms have been signed and
  entered
  
Before the workshop chairs have submitted their books.

- Make sure Rich initializes the camera-ready interface from the NAACL main one.

- Copy the conference metadata to each workshop's page. This is easier
  to do yourself than to tell the workshop chairs how to do it.
