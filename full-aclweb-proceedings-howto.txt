(1) Download the relevant tar balls from all of the workshops/tutorials that will be including in the full proceedings.
-- One way to do this is to use acl-pubs/assets/files/aclweb_proceedings/download-proceedings.sh
-- Usage: ./download-proceedings.sh ${softconf conference acronym in url} ${name of file listing workshop acronyms shown in softconf urls}
-- Example: ./download-proceedings.sh acl2017 workshops.txt

(2) Make the anthology using the make_anthology script, and specifying the workshops/conference proceedings names; the volume IDs; and the volume numbers.
-- See what is already there in acl-pubs/assets/files/aclweb_proceedings/make_anthology.sh
-- Change to reflect the different proceedings collections for the current conference.
-- Usage: ./make_anthology.sh

(3) Send the final thing to Min-Yen.
