<h1>How to produce workshop proceedings for the NAACL 2013 handbook</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <p>
      This page is for conference organizers (main conference, workshop &amp; demo chairs) who need
      to put together a schedule for inclusion in the NAACL handbook. The handbook duties have been
      folded into the responsibilities of the publications co-chairs this
      year. <a href="mailto:clemmer.alexander@gmail.com">Alex Clemmer</a> is heading up the
      construction of the printed handbook; in addition to this, NAACL will also be producing a
      digital version of the handbook that will be browsable on computers and smart phones. Both of
      these proceedings will be generated from the same <tt>order</tt> text files that have been used
      in the past.
    </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <p>
      Producing your conference schedule involves two steps: (1) obtaining the raw data the schedule
      is based around (the papers, dumped from Softconf) and (2) editing the <tt>order</tt> file in
      a canonical way, from which the printed and digital handbooks can be generated.
    </p>

    <h4>0. Preliminaries</h4>

    Please begin by making sure that all of your papers meet the camera-ready standards as laid
    out <a href="camera-ready-faq.htmL">in this document</a>. In particular, there are four main
    areas of compliance you should look for:

    <ol>
      <li><i>Margins</i>. Papers should fit entirely within the margins prescribed by the
        conference booklet. You can check this by going to
        the <a href="https://www.softconf.com/naacl2013/papers/manager/">Conference Manager
          screen</a>, choosing "ACLPUB" from the "Conference Program" list on the right, choosing the
        "Generate" tab, clicking on the "Draft" button to generate the draft, and then browsing the
        resulting file. This will present you with two pages of each paper along with guidelines
        which will show you whether each paper fits within the margins. If not, you can adjust them
        yourself, or email the authors and ask them to do it using the tool provided when they
        uploaded their camera-ready paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Black &amp; White readability</i>. Papers can contain color images, charts, and
        figures, but they should all be interpretable when printed or viewed in grayscale.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>References</i>. Please make sure there are no obvious problems with the formatting of
        the References section.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Metadata</i>. Please make sure there are no obvious problems with the formatting of
        names in the metadata for each paper (which is viewable from the proceedings draft
        index). In particular, authors should be aware that their
        names <a href="camera-ready-faq.html#name-formatting">will be formatted according to how
          they have entered it</a> on their Softconf unified user info page.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Once all of your papers are in place, you can proceed to organizing dumping them and
      organizing them into a schedule.

    <h4>1. Obtaining the proceedings</h4>

    The next task is to obtain the raw proceedings data from Softconf.

    <ul>
      <li>First, <a href="https://www.softconf.com/naacl2013/papers/manager/">log on to
          Softconf</a>. Your screen should look roughly like it does in the screen capture to the
        right.</li>
      <li>On the righthand side is a column marked "Conference Program". There is a hyperlink at the bottom of this column, with the text "ACLPUB". Click it.</li>
      <li>We now generate the proceedings. Click on the "Generate" tab, and under "Generate Button", click "ALL".</li>
      <li>Wait for the generation to finish (this may take awhile).</li>
      <li>Click the download button.</li>
      <li>A file named <tt>proceedings.tgz</tt> will be downloaded to your computer (possibly
        after a prompt). You are done with Softconf and may close your browser.
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Formatting the order file</h4>

    <p>The <tt>proceedings.tgz</tt> tarball will unpack to many files; we call attention to the
    following:</p>

<pre>
  proceedings/
    order
    final/
      1/
        1_Paper.pdf
        1_metadata.txt
      17/
        17_Paper.pdf
        17_metadata.txt
      ...
</pre>

    <p>The <tt>final/</tt> directory contains papers indexed by their submission order, and then
    containing the final PDF and metadata (information about authors, affiliations, and so on, used
    to construct the proceedings index).</p>

    <p>The <tt>order</tt> file is what you use to layout the schedule for the conference. It is
    seeded with all the papers in the conference or workshop; what you need to add are structured
    data such as times, names of sessions, and the order the papers are presented in.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <p>Below is a list of instructions about how to format your proceedings. To the right are a
    sample snippet of an <tt>order</tt> file and the associated LaTeX output that is produced from
    it.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The lines in the file are initially formatted like this: <tt>5 \# Building a large annotated corpus of English: the penn treebank</tt>. These lines corresponds to papers.</li>
      <li>You must now reorder them according to when they are presented, and supplement them with a time slot, <em>e.g.</em>, <tt>5 \# 09:10--09:35 Building a large annotated corpus of English: the penn treebank</tt>.
      <li>Other tools at your disposal:
        <ul>
          <li>The format <tt>* DAY</tt> will cause \LaTeX to render the header marking the start of a new day.</li>
          <li>The format <tt>= HEADLINE</tt> will cause \LaTeX to render that line as a session headline.</li>
          <li>The format <tt>+ TIME DESCRIPTION</tt> will cause \LaTeX to render that line as an additional item.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Submission</h4>

    <p>
      Once you have completed your schedule, please send the <tt>order</tt> file
      to <a href="mailto:clemmer.alexander@gmail.com?cc=naacl-2013-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com&subject=order%20file">Alex
      Clemmer, CCing the NAACL publications chairs.</a>
