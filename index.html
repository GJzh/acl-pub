        <p>When the time is nearer, this page will contain information
          for two groups of people: (1) <b>researchers</b> submitting
          papers (first for peer review, and later the camera ready
          versions of accepted papers), and (2) <b>organizers</b> of
          co-hosted conferences and workshops (to be determined).

        <h3>Information for researchers</h3>

        <p>
        If your paper is accepted, you will have until a certain date
        (TBD) to submit the camera-ready
        version. We recommend using LaTeX to produce your files, and suggest you make use of the
        style files and templates available by clicking on the buttons
        just below. <i>These files will be made available closer to
        the submission deadline.</i>

        <h3>Information for workshop organizers</h3>

        <p>
          The main obligation of workshop organizers (including the
          Student Research Workshop and Demonstrations) to the publications chairs is to deliver a
          camera-ready "book" of the workshop proceedings on time. Our job is to then
          bundle the workshop books together with the main proceedings and release the complete
          proceedings for use at the conference and for hosting on
          the <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/">ACL Anthology</a>.
        </p>

        <!--
        <p>
          Below is a schedule. Of particular note is the bolded item, May 5, which is the date you
          need to turn over your workshop's finished, camera-ready book to us. This is the latest
          date we can accommodate comfortably. We have also provided a suggested deadline for your
          camera-ready workshop papers, which was selected to provide you with enough time to
          assemble your book. More information about book assembly is available in our
          <a href="book.html">Book Instructions and FAQ</a>.
