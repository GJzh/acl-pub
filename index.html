          the <a href="http://naacl2013.naacl.org">NAACL 2013</a> publications co-chairs. Our job is
          to make sure the conference proceedings get put together well and on time.

        <p>This page contains information for two groups of people: (1) <b>researchers</b>
          submitting papers (first for peer review, and later the camera ready versions of accepted
          papers), and (2) <b>organizers</b> of co-hosted conferences (*SEM) and workshops.

        <h3>Information for researchers</h3>

        <p>
        If your paper is accepted, you will have until April 7 to submit the camera-ready
        version. We recommend using LaTeX to produce your files, and suggest you make use of the
        style files and templates available by clicking on the buttons just below.
        </p>

        <p>
        <font color="red"><b>Please see the <a href="camera-ready-faq.html">camera-ready
        FAQ</a></b></font> for more detailed information on formatting the final version of your
        paper.

        <h3>Information for workshop organizers</h3>

        <p>
          The main obligation of workshop organizers to the publications chairs is to deliver a
          camera-ready "book" of the workshop proceedings on time (May 5). Our job is to then
          bundle the workshop books together with the main proceedings and release the complete
          proceedings for use at the conference and for hosting on
          the <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/">ACL Anthology</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below is a schedule. Of particular note is the bolded item, May 5, which is the date you
          need to turn over your workshop's finished, camera-ready book to us. This is the latest
          date we can accommodate comfortably. We have also provided a suggested deadline for your
          camera-ready workshop papers, which was selected to provide you with enough time to
          assemble your book. More information about book assembly will be provided nearer to the
          April 12 suggested camera-ready deadline.
